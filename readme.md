## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

## About The Project

Influencer Social is a UK-based SaaS platform built for social influencers and brands to be connected with each other for brand deals, analytics tracking across multiple platforms and also for other opportunities, such as extra revenue. 

The platform also acts as a management platform for the parent company, Axiquo Media Group. This allows us to manage operations and inter-connect all our core services for increased efficiency.
